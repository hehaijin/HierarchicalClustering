PART 1: Given the dataset in Assignment 1, train three classifiers of your choice on the data to achieve the highest possible cross-validated accuracy. You may use any library you want. You will turn in a report describing your activity and the results you obtain.
PART 2: Program, in your preferred language, a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster the dataset in Assignment 1. You will measure goodness of your clustering using Rand Index. You may tune the cut-off parameter to obtain high accuracy. You may use the knowledge that number of clusters is four.
